    <description>StorageCraft ImageManager helps you maintain and manage backup image files and the storage space used by those files. Based on a policy that you create, ImageManager automatically consolidates incremental backup image files into daily, weekly, and monthly incremental images.</description>
    <summary>Free backup management software for SPX or ShadowProtect backups</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Added new functionality to the ImageManager user Interface that allows you to:
Verify (the currently select backup image).
Verify Chain (verify the chain for the currently selected backup image).
View Chain Shortest Path (shortest chain back to the base image from the currently selected backup image).
*Remove Images not in shortest path.
View Chain Redundant Images* (displays only if the most recent backup image is selected)
A Redundant Image refers to a backup image whose data is contained in the next higher-rolled up consolidation file.

*We strongly suggest not removing images or deleting redundant files without first consulting with StorageCraft support.
Updated VirtualBox plugins to support the latest version of VirtualBox. 
When using S3 replication, you can now enable lifecycle management to clean up old partial uploads (StorageCraft considers this to be a best practice).</releaseNotes>
